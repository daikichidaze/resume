# Repository Structure

Detailed map of the project after forking the Orbit Jekyll theme and personalizing it for a résumé site.

## Root-Level Files
- `README.md` – High-level instructions on running the résumé locally (Docker Compose v2 or Ruby) and pointers to the customizable data, styles, and license details.
- `AGENTS.md` – Internal guidelines for contributors, including project conventions and a note that this repository is a customized fork.
- `LICENSE.md` – Summary of the Orbit theme licensing terms and attribution requirements.
- `CNAME` – Custom domain mapping for GitHub Pages deployment.
- `Gemfile` – Ruby gem dependencies (`jekyll`, `github-pages`, `webrick`) required to build/serve the site.
- `Gemfile.lock` – Locked dependency versions generated by Bundler.
- `docker-compose.yml` – Defines a single service that runs `jekyll serve` inside the `jekyll/builder:4.0` container with live reload enabled.
- `favicon.ico` – Site favicon served in the HTML head.
- `index.html` – Main résumé entry point composed from shared includes.
- `print.html` – Standalone page optimized for printing/PDF export using the print layout.
- `blind.html` – Simplified version of the résumé intended for visually accessible screening.

## Configuration and Data
- `_config.yml` – Jekyll configuration setting the site title, base URL, analytics ID, Sass options, and other build flags.
- `_data/data.yml` – Centralized YAML data source for sidebar profile details, work experience, education, projects, certifications, open-source contributions, and skills.

## Layouts and Includes
- `_layouts/` – HTML shells for different render targets:
  - `default.html` – Standard layout with sidebar, print/PDF buttons, footer, and script includes.
  - `print.html` – Layout tuned for `print.html` with zero padding and full-width wrapper.
  - `blind.html` – Layout for text-centric output without the sidebar.
  - `compress.html` – Utility layout that can compress rendered HTML (inherited from the upstream theme).
- `_includes/` – Modular fragments pulled into pages and layouts:
  - `head.html` – Document head, CSS/JS includes, and optional analytics injection.
  - `analytics.html` – Google Analytics setup snippet executed when `site.analytics` is configured.
  - `sidebar.html` – Profile panel markup plus nested includes (`contact.html`, `language.html`, `interests.html`, `education.html`, `about.html`).
  - `career-profile.html`, `experiences.html`, `certifications.html`, `projects.html`, `oss-contributions.html`, `education.html`, `publications.html`, `recommendations.html`, `skills.html` – Section templates that read from `_data/data.yml` and render headings plus list content.
  - `contact.html`, `language.html`, `interests.html`, `about.html` – Sidebar detail blocks driven by YAML data.
  - `footer.html` – Footer credits mandated by the Orbit license.
  - `scripts.html` – JavaScript bundle placeholder (note: currently contains unresolved merge conflict markers between legacy jQuery/bootstrap includes and the analytics snippet).
  - `head.html` and `scripts.html` both reference `pdf-generator.js` to support inline print/PDF actions.

## Styling Assets
- `assets/css/main.scss` – Top-level stylesheet that sets Sass variables based on sidebar placement and imports the selected skin plus the `_sass/_default.scss` partial bundle.
- `_sass/` – Sass partials composing the theme:
  - `_base.scss`, `_utilities.scss`, `_responsive.scss`, `_mixins.scss` – Core styles, helpers, and responsiveness.
  - `_default.scss` – Central partial importing the rest of the modular styles.
  - `_print.scss`, `_blind.scss` – Overrides for print and blind layouts.
  - `skins/` – Color schemes (`_blue.scss`, `_turquoise.scss`, `_green.scss`, `_berry.scss`, `_orange.scss`, `_ceramic.scss`, `_teal.scss`, `_oceanstale.scss`) selectable via `theme_skin` in `_config.yml`.

## JavaScript and Plugins
- `assets/js/pdf-generator.js` – Custom script that opens the print page for browsers’ print dialog and uses `html2pdf.js` to export the résumé as a PDF with a filename derived from the profile name.
- `assets/plugins/` – Vendored third-party assets:
  - `bootstrap/` – Bootstrap CSS/JS bundle and supporting files.
  - `font-awesome/` – Font Awesome icons (CSS, SVGs, webfonts, metadata).
- `assets/pdf/` – Directory reserved for manual PDF uploads (currently empty).
- `assets/images/` – Contains profile and illustrative imagery used across the site (fill with résumé-specific assets).

## Generated Artifacts
- `_site/` – Jekyll build output kept in the repository for reference or static hosting. Mirrors rendered pages (`index.html`, `print.html`, `blind.html`) and compiled assets.
- `.sass-cache/` – Build cache generated by Sass for faster recompilation.

## Tooling and Metadata
- `.github/FUNDING.yml` – GitHub funding links retained from the upstream project.
- `.gitignore` – Ignore rules for build artifacts and editor detritus.
- `.git/` – Git metadata (present because this is a working clone).

## Additional Notes
- The project is configured for GitHub Pages; updating `_config.yml` and `_data/data.yml` is the primary workflow for content edits.
- Generated directories (`_site/`, `.sass-cache/`) can be cleaned before committing if not required.
- Resolve the conflict in `_includes/scripts.html` before shipping builds to avoid missing scripts or duplicated analytics snippets.
